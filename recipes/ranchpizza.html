    <h2>This pizza is fast to make when using rotisserie chicken,
         and prepared pizza dough. For an even quicker preparation
         use already cooked bacon crumbles. I cook my pizza in a cast
         iron skillet for a slight crunch to my dough.
         Serve with a small salad if desired.

        <li>⅓ cup ranch dressing</li>
        <li>6 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>⅓ cup cubed, cooked chicken</li>
        <li>⅛ cup sliced red onion</li>
        <li>1 small tomato, sliced</li><li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Cook bacon in a large skillet and over medium-high heat,
         turning occasionally, until evenly browned,
         about 10 minutes. Drain bacon on paper towels and cool.
        </li>
        <li>Pour oil into a 12-inch cast iron skillet. Brush oil all over the interior of the skillet. Place dough into the skillet and shape into a pizza,
         forming a crust at the edge. Prick dough all over with a fork.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 5 minutes.
         Remove from oven and reshape dough if necessary.
         Sprinkle the top of the dough with 2 teaspoons ranch seasoning.
         Spread ranch dressing on top.
        </li>
        <li>Sprinkle shredded mozzarella, chicken,
         and red onion over pizza crust. Crumble cooled bacon on top.</li>
         <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted
         and top is browned, about 20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Remove pizza from oven and top with tomato slices. Melt butter and mix in the remaining dry
         ranch seasoning. Brush crust with butter-ranch mixture.
        </li>
        <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches
         from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
        </li>
        <li>Broil pizza until cheese is golden brown,
         2 to 3 minutes, being careful not to burn.
        </li>
    </ol>
